# Optimization-Methods-with-Applications
**Syllabus**
This course aims to provide algorithmic and numerical tools for solving common
computational optimization problems in science and engineering.
The course will include: linear algebra reminder: norms, least squares,
eigenvalue and singular value decompositions, optimization of quadratic
problems. Convexity, iterative methods for unconstrained optimization
(Steepest Descent, Newton, Quasi-Newton, Conjugate Gradients, subspace
methods, BFGS), and line-search methods. Constrained optimization with
equality and inequality constraints (method of Lagrange multipliers and KKT
optimality conditions), linear and quadratic programming, penalty, barrier and
projection methods. Duality. Splitting methods and ADMM. Introduction to
stochastic optimization (SGD). Introduction to non-smooth and sparse
optimization. Robust statistics for dealing with outliers.
The assignments in this course will include writing computer programs for
practically implementing and demonstrating the algorithms taught in this
course.
